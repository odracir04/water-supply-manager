# Water Supply Managament
> Project developed for DA 23/24, by Nuno Machado, Rafael Magalh√£es, Ricardo Oliveira.

## Functionalities to implement:
- User-friendly interface
- Read and Parse Input Data
- Documentation and Time Complexity Analysis
- Information about the network.

## Information necessary about the network:
- Maximum water that reaches a city
- Maximum water that reaches all cities
- Does the water network meet all needs?
- Algorithm to balance the water flow
- What would happen to the network if a water supply was removed?
- What would happen to the network if a pumping station was removed?
- What would happen to the network if a pipe was removed?
